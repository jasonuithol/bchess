# bchess
A terminal based chess engine written in C, the purpose of which was to unteach me chess.

This is a sort of on and off again foray into the world of C.  It's definitely not meant to be part of a team effort, so I am absolutely allowed to convert tabs to spaces whenever I deem fit, proper or otherwise.  No Agile Scrum Masters or Continuous Integration DevOps were harmed in the making of this code.

The master branch is my first crack and is actually a few years older than the creation of this repository, and honestly needs to be moved to a "legacy" branch now.  Please consider "bitboard" to be the baseline.
