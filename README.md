# bchess
A terminal based chess engine written in C, the purpose of which was to unteach me chess.

NOTE: If you are reviewing this code under the constraints of a contractual obligation, then I will warn you now that chess AIs tend to focus on correctness and performance, not enterprise maintainability (unlike, of course, actual enterprise software).  This AI is different, in that whilst it is not 100% correct, it certainly isn't fast either. On display will be my vast ignorance of how the various compilers of C actually work (I did force myself to learn a trick or two here and there, as you'll learn if you're unwise enough to look at the commit history), and a complete and reckless disregard for how others (or my future self) might comprehend this code.  This was not meant to achieve anything other than purely personal ambitions, and self-evidently enough (I hope), not to impress you, the casual observer.

This is a sort of on and off again foray into the world of C.  It's definitely not meant to be part of a team effort, so I am absolutely allowed to convert tabs to spaces whenever I deem fit, proper or otherwise.  No Agile Scrum Masters or Continuous Integration DevOps were harmed in the making of this code.

The master branch is my first crack and is actually a few years older than the creation of this repository, and honestly needs to be moved to a "legacy" branch now.  Please consider "bitboard" to be the baseline.
